# Open ZaakBrug deployment Instructions 


## Commit/PR-CI

In the Open ZaakBrug repository we use github actions for the ci/cd. 
First of all the CI tool will build the application and run the unit tests.
Afterwards, it will start the application in docker container (this step might be redundant however 
we had some problems in the past that the application was not working properly in docker container)
Just to see that the OZB performs well in docker container, ci tool (using curl) will ask OZB to generate zaak identification.
Then, if the CI tool is triggered for a commit to the master it will create a docker image and push it to docker hub. 
(https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openzaakbrug/openzaakbrug)

## Versioning

We use github tags to specify the version of the image.(https://github.com/Sudwest-Fryslan/OpenZaakBrug/tags)
CI tool will look for the latest created tag and use that for the docker image version.
In case there is no new tag created then the existing version will be overwritten.
Just before accepting the PR create a git tag and push the tag to the origin.

	git tag <tagname>			//will create a local tag
	git push origin <tagname>	//will push the created tag to origin

## Configuration update
In OZB, there are two configuration files which may require changes for the deployment. Namely, _application.properties_ and _config.json_. These files are located in _/root/config_ folder and mounted to the docker container.
Analyze PR to check whether the deployment requires changes in one of these files or not. Then, do the change.

## Deployment
Time to update the docker image. There is a script called update_ozb.sh in the _/root_ folder of the **root** user.
Run 

	./update_ozb.sh <version>
to update the docker image. If something goes wrong during the update it will be visible in the terminal. Then the log file of the deployment needs to be examined. 
There is a folder called _update_ozb_history_ in the _/root_ folder which keeps the log files of the deployments with the name in the following format _```update_ozb_<timestamp>.log```_
Depending on the error message troubleshooting may differ. 

## Post deployment
It is always a good practice to check the basic consequences of the deployment. 
I always run 

	docker logs OpenZaakBrug 

command to display the startup log of OZB (just to verify that no exception is occurred while starting the application)

Example output after a successfull deployment:

In case the deployment is expected to make changes in the database also check the database to confirm that the expected changes are in place.

You are all settled :)

## Logging
By default docker will log the stdout of the application and store it in _`/var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>`_
The log file is a json file and is rotating with 10 files 10MB each. These settings can be adjusted by editing the file _/etc/docker/deamon.json_
After editing the file do not forget to restart the deamon (```systemctl restart dockerd```)

## Nginx 
In case nginx requires some adjustments the config file can be found in _/etc/nginx/conf.d/_.
Do not forget to restart nginx after making changes (```systemctl restart nginx```)

## Asked questions

#### Docker volumes

	In het update script zie ik: -v /root/config:/home/config -v data-debug:/home/data. Waar kan ik de data-debug folder vinden? Zit niet onder /root zo te zien, maar waar dan wel? 

	The former will mount the folder in the host machine to the docker container and the latter(data-debug) is the name of the volume. It will keep the persisted data in /home/data folder in the docker container. Available volumes can be seen by executing the command:  docker volume ls
